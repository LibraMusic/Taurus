# Taurus

Taurus is a simple configuration library for Go.
It was originally developed as part of [LibraCore](https://github.com/LibraMusic/LibraCore) to replace Viper.

The [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) configuration library is great, but it didn't quite fit Libra's needs.
Taurus is meant to provide the main features of Viper without all of its complexity.
